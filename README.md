# OpenIoT - The Open Source Internet of Things


**===============================Curently the project is not maintained===============================**


-----------------------------------------------------

**OpenIoT is building a novel open source platform for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which includes unique functionalities such as the capability to compose (dynamically and on-demand) non-trivial IoT services, following a cloud/utility based paradigm**

**OpenIoT is a joint effort of prominent open source contributors towards enabling a new range of open large scale intelligent IoT (Internet-of- things) applications according to a utility cloud computing delivery model.**



------------------------------------------------------


The OpenIoT middleware infrastructure supports flexible configuration and deployment of algorithms for collection, and filtering information streams stemming from the internet-connected objects, while at the same time generating and processing important business/applications events.

OpenIoT is a joint effort of prominent open source contributors towards enabling a new range of open large scale intelligent IoT (Internet-of- things) applications according to a utility cloud computing delivery model.

OpenIoT is perceived as a natural extension to cloud computing implementations, which will allow access to additional and increasingly important IoT based resources and capabilities. In particular, OpenIoT will research and provide the means for formulating and managing environments comprising IoT resources, which can deliver on-demand utility IoT services such as sensing as a service.

OpenIoT is pertinent to a wide range of interrelated scientific and technological areas spanning: 
* Middleware for sensors and sensor networks,
* Ontologies, semantic models and annotations for representing internet-connected objects, along with semantic open-linked data techniques
* Cloud/Utility computing, including utility based security and privacy schemes.

-------------------------------------------------------------

OpenIoT is developing a bluepring middleware infrastructure for implementing/integrating Internet-of-Things solutions. The OpenIoT infrastructure will provide the means for:
* Collecting and processing data from virtually any sensor in the world, including physical devices, sensor processing algorithms, social media processing algorithms and more. Note that in OpenIoT the term sensor refers to any components that can provide observations. OpenIoT will facilitate the integration of the above sensors with only minimal effort (i.e. few man days effort) for implementing an appropriate access driver.
* Semantically annotating sensor data, according to the W3C Semantic Sensor Networks (SSN) specifications. 
* Streaming the data of the various sensors to a cloud computing infrastructure. 
* Dynamically discovering/querying sensors and their data.
* Composing and delivering IoT services that comprise data from multiple sensors.
* Visualizing IoT data based on appropriate mashups (charts, graphs, maps etc.)
* Optimizing resources within the OpenIoT middleware and cloud computing infrastructure.

OpenIoT combines and enhances results from leading edge middleware projects, such as the [Global Sensor Networks (GSN)](http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/gsn) and the [Linked Sensor Middleware (LSM)](http://code.google.com/p/deri-lsm/) projects.
