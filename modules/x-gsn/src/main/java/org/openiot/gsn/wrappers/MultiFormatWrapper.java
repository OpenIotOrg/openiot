/**
 * This wrapper presents a MultiFormat protocol in which the data comes from the
 * system clock. Think about a sensor network which produces packets with
 * several different formats. In this example we have 3 different packets
 * produced by three different types of sensors. Here are the packet structures
 * : [temperature:double] , [light:double] , [temperature:double, light:double]
 * The first packet is for sensors which can only measure temperature while the
 * latter is for the sensors equipped with both temperature and light sensors.
