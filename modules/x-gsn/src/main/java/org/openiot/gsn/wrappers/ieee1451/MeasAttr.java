    * The dimension of a measurement, such as mass, capacitance, charge, etc.

    * before we've seen any values (and thus any units). Or we may want to force
    * it to have a particular dimension: we will accept any unit associated with
    * that dimension, but reject all others. Once we can restrict a measurement
    * (strictly, the record containing a measurement) to a dimension, then we
    * can make use of the ability to specialize dimensions. This lets us keep
    * output voltages separate from input voltages. You can still compute the
    * ratio of those two; but if you tried to include the wrong thing in a
    * moving average, say, you'd get an exception.
